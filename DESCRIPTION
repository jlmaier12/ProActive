Description: 
  The `ProActive` R package automatically detects regions of gapped and elevated 
  read coverage using a pattern-matching algorithm. `ProActive` can detect, characterize 
  and visualize read coverage patterns in both genomes and metagenomes. Optionally, 
  users may provide gene annotations associated with their genome or metagenome 
  in the form of a .gff file. In this case, `ProActive` will generate an additional 
  output table containing the ORFs found within the detected regions of gapped 
  and elevated read coverage.
