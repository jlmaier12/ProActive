ProActive detects, characterizes visualizes read coverage patterns genomes metagenomes.

Additionally, users can search gene annotations interest output read coverage plots. Visualizing read coverage data important gaps elevations coverage can indicators variety biological non-biological scenarios, example- Elevations gaps read coverage may caused types structural variants. Deletions can cause gaps duplications can cause elevations read coverage [1]. Highly active /abundant mobile genetic elements, like transposable elements [2] prophage [3] example, can create elevations read coverage respective integration sites. Genetic regions high mutation rates /high variability within population can generate gaps read coverage [4]. Poor quality sequencing reads chimeric reference sequences may cause gaps elevations read coverage. Since cause gaps elevations read coverage can ambiguous, ProActive best used screening method identify genetic regions investigation tools! References: Tattini L., D’Aurizio R., & Magi . (2015).

Visualizing read coverage data important gaps elevations coverage can indicators variety biological non-biological scenarios, example- Elevations gaps read coverage may caused types structural variants. Deletions can cause gaps duplications can cause elevations read coverage [1]. Highly active /abundant mobile genetic elements, like transposable elements [2] prophage [3] example, can create elevations read coverage respective integration sites. Genetic regions high mutation rates /high variability within population can generate gaps read coverage [4]. Poor quality sequencing reads chimeric reference sequences may cause gaps elevations read coverage.
