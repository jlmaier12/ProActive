\usage{
full_RCgap_func(microbial_subset, windowsize, minsize, maxsize)
}
\arguments{
\item{microbial_subset}{A subset of the read coverage dataset that pertains only to the contig currently being assessed}

\item{windowsize}{The window size used to re-average read coverage datasets}

\item{minsize}{The minimum size of elevated read coverage that ProActive searches for. Default is 10000 base pairs.}

\item{maxsize}{The minimum size of elevated read coverage that ProActive searches for. Default is the close to the length of the contig being assessed.}
}
\description{
Build the full prophage shape and provide it as input to the proshape_translator_func to be translated across a contig. The shape is made smaller length-wise 2000bp at a time, and the shape stops decreasing in length once it reaches 10000bp.
