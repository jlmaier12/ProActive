\title{Plot read coverage graphs of contigs with predicted active prophages in the whole-community read coverages}
\usage{
ProActivePredictionPlots(
  metagenome_pileup,
  ProActive_shapelist,
  ProActive_summarydf,
  windowsize = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metagenome_pileup}{A table containing contig names, coverages averaged over 100bp windows, and contig positions associated with mapping whole-community reads to whole-community contigs}

\item{ProActive_shapelist}{A list containing shape information associated with all contigs containing a potential active prophage. The third item in the list output from the main prophage_activity_finder_func}

\item{ProActive_summarydf}{Prediction summary table with active prophage information. The first item in the list output from the main prophage_activity_finder_func function.}

\item{windowsize}{The window size used to re-average read coverage datasets}
}
\description{
Plot the read coverages of a contig and its associated shape-match for each contig with a predicted active prophage.
