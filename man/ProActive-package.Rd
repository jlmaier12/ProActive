\description{
Automatic detection of gaps and elevations in mapped sequencing reads using read coverage
  pattern-matching. Pattern-matching results are summarized into a dataframe and users can visualize the
  pattern-matches and associated read coverage patterns. If a .gff file is supplied, ProActive will output
  the ORFs found within the detected regions of elevated and/or gapped read coverage. ProActive works with both
  metagenomes and genomes.
}
\details{
The two main functions in ProActive are:
\enumerate{
\item \code{\link{ProActive}} performs the pattern-matching and characterization of read coverage patterns.
\item \code{\link{plotProActiveResults}} plots the results from
 \code{ProActive()}
}
}
