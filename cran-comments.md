## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed description text so it does not start with 'this package does..'

* Removed all use of directed quotation marks in description text

* Fixed a bug where use of the elevFilter parameter in the plotProActiveResults 
function produced an error message

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
